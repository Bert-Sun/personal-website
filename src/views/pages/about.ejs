            I am a student at the University of Waterloo pursuing a <b>Bachelors of Mathematics in Data Science.</b>
            For more on my math interests, check out <a href="#math" class="text-dark">my math subsection.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            I am most familiar with <span class="text-primary"><b>C++ (and its STL)</b></span>, <span class="text-success"><b>Python</b></span> and <span class="text-danger"><b>JavaScript</b></span>, 
            and libraries such as <span class="text-success"><b>TensorFlow, NumPy and pandas</b></span>, <span class="text-danger"><b>Node.js and TypeScript</b></span>.
            I'm still comfortable using other languages such <b>SQL</b> and <b>VBA</b> for MS Access and Excel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of studying, I enjoy playing video games such as <b>Borderlands 2</b>, <b>Apex Legends</b> and <b>Valorant</b> to name a few. (I'm terrible though ðŸ˜Š)

                <p>C++ was my first programming language, having learned it with the purpose of using it for competitive programming.
                Eventually, I went onwards to use it to build firmware for my <a href="#keyboard" class="text-dark">keyboard</a>, and experiment
                with CUDA programming. 
                My favourite resource for anyone beginning to learn C++ syntax or programming methodologies would be
                <a class="text-dark" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw" target="_blank">The Cherno</a>.
                Just as when you speak a language fluently and don't have to think about grammar, The Cherno has helped me develop an intuitive
                sense for C++ idiomatic code and best coding practices. </p>

              <div id="python" style="display:none">
                <p>Python was one of those languages that I ended up picking up simply because everyone else around me used Python instead of C++.
                While at first I didn't enjoy the "Oh yeah, this thing that you want to do has been done for you, you just have to know that it's hiding 
                in this library" aspect. However, as I started getting more into AI/ML it slowly became more evident how useful it was to have libraries such as
                NumPy or pandas at my disposal. </p>

              <div id="node" style="display:none">
                <p>In terms of building websites, Node.js and MEAN stack are what I feel most comfortable with. Starting out with a few hackathon projects, I've moved on
                to build a e-commerce website for Aceway Canada on Node, as well as my own personal website. While I could not say I am a master using Node, I have
                become quite familiar with using Node for any full stack development I would want to do.</p>

                  My first foray into relational databases was using SQL to maintain a catalogue of searchable parts for Aceway Canada. On top of being searchable by
                  a short description, parts were also categorized as compatible with certain car manufacturers, models and years, and some even engine sizes!
                  A lot of my knowledge on relational databases comes from having to suffer through the headache of redesigning and modifying old (and badly designed)
                  schemas to suit newer specifications.

                While I claim C++ as my first programming language, VBA was the first language I was exposed to when I attended a math summer camp in grade 6.
                Even though I managed to make a (barely) functional Cookie Clicker clone, I quickly forgot about VBA. However, as I started helping my mother with
                some of her tasks, I was able to quickly pick up VBA once again to help her with fixing the buggy code left behind by other coop students after their
                term ended.

              My interest for the field of mathematics began in grade 7 when my parents sent me off to take extracurricular math classes.
              I quickly realized how fun it was to make sense of complex formulas to derive results that looked like pure magic.
              The same summer when I attended a math camp (also where I learned <a href="javascript:go('vba'); set('#tech')" class="text-dark">VBA</a>)
              I was introduced to group theory. To my grade 7 brain that had only worked with numbers, seeing an underlying structure to not only all of
              math as I knew it sparked my interest.
              To this day, I remain interested in <b>abstract algebra</b>. I hope that as I continue to study more abstract algebra, I can eventually learn content
              relevant to <b>quantum information</b>.

              Other than <b>Borderlands 2</b>, <b>Apex</b> and <b>Valorant</b> already mentioned above, I also enjoy relaxing on a server
              with friends playing modded <b>Minecraft</b> and <b>Terraria</b>. I've hosted my own Minecraft and <b>Factorio</b> servers before!

              <b>The Portal Series:</b> <br>
              I can never leave a logic problem alone. Whether it be math or a puzzle-solving game, once I am presented with a challenge I have to sit down and complete it.
              On top of the base game are community made maps that push your brain even further, and even 
              <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/" target="_blank" class="text-dark">time portals</a>
              to hurt your brain even further.

              <p>
                Being a programmer, I could not neglect my most used tool: my keyboard. Currently as I writing up this website, I am using a Mr. Suit R2 with Gateron Ink Blacks.
                While having a neat keyboard and nice marble-y typing sound is quite awesome, I did end up learning a lot as I delved into this hobby as well.
                Currently I'm getting into writing my own custom firmware using <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware" target="_blank" class="text-dark">QMK</a>
                and handwiring a custom 3D print. In the future, I hope to also work with a few engineering friends to also CNC a metal case and perhaps even have a PCB printed
                instead of handwiring.
